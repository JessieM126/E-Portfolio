Hey there,

I am Jinxin Mao. I am currently in Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management program at UBC. I recently graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from McGill University, eager to contribute academic knowledge and passion for sustainability to a dynamic role in the field of environment and ecology. I am Well-versed in geographic information system, environmental impact assessment, data analysis, and sustainable practices and have strong research and problem-solving skills complemented by a commitment to promoting environmental stewardship. I am seeking an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting to make a positive impact on the environment.
